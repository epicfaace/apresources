Running Jekyll

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run Jekyll with Bundler. Use the command bundle exec jekyll serve in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch for project repositories), and your site should be available at http://localhost:4000. For a full list of Jekyll commands, see the Jekyll documentation.

To keep Jekyll up to date, you can run the command bundle update 


bundle exec jekyll serve
bundle update
